Hey! My name is Avery Miller. I make a show called Game Glitch, work in Adobe After Effects CC and Photoshop, and often attempt to draw and animate stuff. I've been interviewed on [NPR][0], made a website for [Rhett and Link][1], and I've done some photoshopping the animated version of [Zoophobia][2].

My YouTube channel has more than 2,500 subscribers and over 41,000 views in total.

You can find me on [YouTube][3], [Twitter][4], and [Tumblr][5]. And the internet in general.

Now, here's me without a nose:
