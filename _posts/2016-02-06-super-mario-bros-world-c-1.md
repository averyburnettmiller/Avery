I've been playing though all 256 possible glitch-levels in the original Super Mario Bros. game for the next Game Glitch episode. I actually came across world (c)-1\. That's right, it's world copyright symbol. Ironically, I died after playing the level for only a few seconds. That's several seconds longer than most people survive in the copyright world.
