Here's a drawing I just finished making! I thought I'd practice my animation skills a few weeks ago, so I attempted to replicate Vivienne Medrano's Die Young Animation.

After finishing the latest Game Glitch episode, I thought I'd try to finalize the animation, and after a few hours, I have just one frame.

But hey, that's pretty good.
