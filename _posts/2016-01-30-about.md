Hey! My name is Avery Miller. I make a show called Game Glitch. I work in Adobe After Effects CC and Photoshop. I also can code in HTML (if you can't already tell), plus, I often attempt to draw and animate stuff.

In the summer of 2014, I was interviewed on [NPR's Hear and Now.][0] Pretty epic.

My YouTube channel has more than 2,500 subscribers and over 41,000 views in total.

You can find me on [YouTube][1], [Twitter][2], and [Tumblr][3]. And the internet in general.
