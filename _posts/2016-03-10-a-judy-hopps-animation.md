I thought I was done drawing stuff from Zootopia (Rich Moore already retweeted the last drawing I did, so [insert George Costanza GIF here][0]), but after seeing [this D23 video][1], I had to give it a shot!

One drawing quickly evolved into an animation with quite a few frames. It's the first pen-and-paper animate I've ever done, and I got to say, I think paper is a lot easier to animate with than my typical Wacom tablet and Animate CC. (I think the most difficult part animating with an Intuos is that you need some really good hand-eye-coordination, because you're drawing on the tablet, and you're looking at a screen, and I have nada hand-eye-coordination.) Paper just feels more natural.

I inked all 13 frames over a period of  3 days, then scanned them in, ran them through a couple Photoshop filters (I drew them on lined paper, so I had to remove the lines. In retrospect, I probably should have drawn with a green/red pen so it would have had more contrasted with the paper. Or maybe just used blank paper? That probably would have worked a lot better. ðŸ‘Œ), stabilized the frames a bit, then put them together in After Effects.

I'm really happy with how it turned out!

_(It's worth mentioning that I am not affiliated with Disney in anyway and this animation is completely for fun.)_
